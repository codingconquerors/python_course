### Python Variables Tutorial

Variables in Python are used to store information that can be referenced and manipulated in a program. They are essential building blocks of Python programming. This tutorial will cover the basics of variables, including how to declare, initialize, and use them.

### 1. Declaring and Initializing Variables

In Python, you don't need to declare a variable explicitly. You just assign a value to a variable to initialize it. Python is dynamically typed, meaning the type of the variable is inferred from the value assigned.

#### Example:

```python
# Integer variable
x = 10

# Float variable
y = 3.14

# String variable
name = "Alice"

# Boolean variable
is_active = True

# List variable
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

### 2. Variable Naming Rules

- Variable names must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).
- The rest of the name can include letters, digits (0-9), or underscores.
- Variable names are case-sensitive (`myVar` and `myvar` are different).
- Avoid using reserved words (keywords) as variable names (e.g., `class`, `for`, `if`).

#### Examples:

```python
valid_name = "John"
_valid_name = "Doe"
validName123 = 100

# Invalid variable names
# 1invalid_name = 10  # Starts with a digit
# for = "loop"        # Uses a reserved keyword
```

### 3. Assigning Values to Variables

You can assign values to variables using the assignment operator (`=`). Python also supports multiple assignments.

#### Single Assignment:

```python
age = 25
height = 175.5
country = "USA"
```

#### Multiple Assignments:

```python
a, b, c = 1, 2, 3
print(a, b, c)  # Output: 1 2 3

# Swapping values
a, b = b, a
print(a, b)  # Output: 2 1
```

### 4. Constants

In Python, constants are usually defined using all uppercase letters to indicate that their values should not change. However, Python does not enforce this by default; it is a convention followed by programmers.

```python
PI = 3.14159
MAX_USERS = 100
```

### 5. Data Types

Variables can hold values of different data types. The common data types in Python include:

- **Integer** (`int`): Whole numbers.
- **Float** (`float`): Decimal numbers.
- **String** (`str`): Sequence of characters.
- **Boolean** (`bool`): `True` or `False`.
- **List** (`list`): Ordered collection of items.
- **Tuple** (`tuple`): Ordered, immutable collection of items.
- **Dictionary** (`dict`): Unordered collection of key-value pairs.
- **Set** (`set`): Unordered collection of unique items.

#### Examples:

```python
# Integer
x = 42

# Float
y = 3.14

# String
name = "Alice"

# Boolean
is_student = True

# List
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Tuple
coordinates = (10.0, 20.0)

# Dictionary
person = {"name": "Bob", "age": 30}

# Set
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 3, 4}  # Duplicates will be removed
```

### 6. Checking Variable Types

You can check the type of a variable using the `type()` function.

```python
x = 10
print(type(x))  # Output: <class 'int'>

y = 3.14
print(type(y))  # Output: <class 'float'>

name = "Alice"
print(type(name))  # Output: <class 'str'>
```

### 7. Variable Scope

The scope of a variable refers to the context in which it is defined and accessible. Python has four types of variable scopes:

- **Local Scope**: Variables defined inside a function.
- **Enclosing Scope**: Variables defined in a nested function's parent function.
- **Global Scope**: Variables defined at the top-level of a script or module.
- **Built-in Scope**: Names preassigned in Python (e.g., `print`, `len`).

#### Example:

```python
global_var = "I am global"

def outer_function():
    enclosing_var = "I am in the outer function"
    
    def inner_function():
        local_var = "I am local"
        print(local_var)  # Accessible
        print(enclosing_var)  # Accessible
        print(global_var)  # Accessible
    
    inner_function()
    # print(local_var)  # Error: local_var is not accessible here

outer_function()
# print(enclosing_var)  # Error: enclosing_var is not accessible here
```

### 8. Best Practices

- Use meaningful variable names that convey the purpose of the variable.
- Follow naming conventions (e.g., `snake_case` for variables and functions, `PascalCase` for classes).
- Keep the scope of variables as narrow as possible to avoid unintended side effects.

### Summary

Variables are fundamental to Python programming, allowing you to store and manipulate data. Understanding how to declare, initialize, and use variables effectively is crucial for writing clear and maintainable code. Follow the best practices and conventions to ensure your code is readable and understandable by others.
