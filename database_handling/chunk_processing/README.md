Chunk processing is a technique used to handle large datasets efficiently by processing them in smaller, manageable chunks. This prevents memory overload and improves performance. Below is an example of how you can implement chunk processing with a MySQL database using Python.

### Prerequisites

First, you need to install the necessary libraries:

```sh
pip install pymysql pandas sqlalchemy
```

### Step 1: Setting Up the Database Connection

We'll use `SQLAlchemy` for the database connection and `pandas` for data manipulation.

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
import pandas as pd

# Replace with your MySQL database credentials
DATABASE_URI = 'mysql+pymysql://username:password@hostname:port/dbname'
engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URI)
```

### Step 2: Define the Chunk Processing Function

Create a function to process data in chunks.

```python
def process_chunk(chunk):
    # Example processing: Filter rows where a specific column value meets a condition
    filtered_chunk = chunk[chunk['age'] > 30]
    # Process your data here (e.g., perform computations, transformations, etc.)
    # For demonstration, we will just print the number of rows in each chunk
    print(f"Processed chunk with {len(filtered_chunk)} rows")
```

### Step 3: Implement Chunk Processing

Write a function to read and process the database table in chunks.

```python
def process_large_database(table_name, chunk_size=1000):
    offset = 0
    while True:
        query = f"SELECT * FROM {table_name} LIMIT {chunk_size} OFFSET {offset}"
        chunk = pd.read_sql(query, engine)
        if chunk.empty:
            break
        process_chunk(chunk)
        offset += chunk_size

# Example usage
process_large_database('your_table_name')
```

### Putting It All Together

Here's the complete script:

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
import pandas as pd

# Replace with your MySQL database credentials
DATABASE_URI = 'mysql+pymysql://username:password@hostname:port/dbname'
engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URI)

def process_chunk(chunk):
    # Example processing: Filter rows where a specific column value meets a condition
    filtered_chunk = chunk[chunk['age'] > 30]
    # Process your data here (e.g., perform computations, transformations, etc.)
    # For demonstration, we will just print the number of rows in each chunk
    print(f"Processed chunk with {len(filtered_chunk)} rows")

def process_large_database(table_name, chunk_size=1000):
    offset = 0
    while True:
        query = f"SELECT * FROM {table_name} LIMIT {chunk_size} OFFSET {offset}"
        chunk = pd.read_sql(query, engine)
        if chunk.empty:
            break
        process_chunk(chunk)
        offset += chunk_size

# Example usage
process_large_database('your_table_name')
```

### Explanation

1. **Database Connection**: We establish a connection to the MySQL database using SQLAlchemy.
2. **Chunk Processing Function**: `process_chunk` function handles the processing of each chunk. In this example, it filters rows based on a condition and prints the number of rows.
3. **Main Function**: `process_large_database` function reads the database table in chunks using the SQL `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` clauses. It processes each chunk using the `process_chunk` function.

### Additional Tips

- **Error Handling**: Add appropriate error handling to manage database connection issues or data processing errors.
- **Parallel Processing**: For even better performance, consider using parallel processing with libraries like `multiprocessing` or `concurrent.futures` to process multiple chunks simultaneously.
- **Logging**: Implement logging to keep track of the progress and any issues during processing.

### Enhancements

You can enhance the script to handle more complex processing, logging, and error handling as needed based on your specific use case. This example provides a basic structure to get you started with chunk processing in Python using a MySQL database.
