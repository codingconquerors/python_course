Abstract methods in Python are defined in abstract base classes (ABCs) and are used to enforce that derived classes implement particular methods. They help in designing classes with a clear interface and ensure that subclasses provide specific behaviors. Abstract methods are declared using the `abc` module.

### Benefits of Abstract Methods

1. **Enforcing a Contract**: Abstract methods ensure that subclasses implement the required methods.
2. **Improved Code Organization**: They help in organizing code by defining a clear interface that subclasses must adhere to.
3. **Polymorphism**: They facilitate polymorphism by allowing different classes to be used interchangeably if they implement the same interface.
4. **Prevents Instantiation**: Abstract base classes cannot be instantiated, which prevents the creation of incomplete objects.

### Example Demonstrating Abstract Methods

Let's create an example to demonstrate the benefits of abstract methods.

1. **Define an Abstract Base Class**
2. **Implement Concrete Subclasses**
3. **Use the Subclasses Polymorphically**

#### Step 1: Define an Abstract Base Class

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def perimeter(self):
        pass
```

#### Step 2: Implement Concrete Subclasses

```python
class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height

    def area(self):
        return self.width * self.height

    def perimeter(self):
        return 2 * (self.width + self.height)

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    def area(self):
        return 3.14159 * self.radius * self.radius

    def perimeter(self):
        return 2 * 3.14159 * self.radius
```

#### Step 3: Use the Subclasses Polymorphically

```python
def print_shape_info(shape: Shape):
    print(f"Area: {shape.area()}")
    print(f"Perimeter: {shape.perimeter()}")

# Create instances of Rectangle and Circle
rect = Rectangle(3, 4)
circle = Circle(5)

# Use the function with different shapes
print("Rectangle Info:")
print_shape_info(rect)
print("\nCircle Info:")
print_shape_info(circle)
```

### Explanation

1. **Abstract Base Class (`Shape`)**:
    - Defined using the `ABC` class from the `abc` module.
    - Contains two abstract methods: `area` and `perimeter`.

2. **Concrete Subclasses (`Rectangle` and `Circle`)**:
    - Inherit from `Shape`.
    - Implement the abstract methods `area` and `perimeter`.

3. **Polymorphism**:
    - The `print_shape_info` function takes an argument of type `Shape` and calls the `area` and `perimeter` methods.
    - Both `Rectangle` and `Circle` instances can be passed to this function, demonstrating polymorphism.

### Benefits in Action

- **Enforcing a Contract**: The abstract methods in `Shape` ensure that any subclass (e.g., `Rectangle` and `Circle`) must implement the `area` and `perimeter` methods. If a subclass does not implement these methods, it cannot be instantiated, thus enforcing a contract.
- **Improved Code Organization**: The abstract class defines a clear interface for shapes, making the code more organized and easier to understand.
- **Polymorphism**: The `print_shape_info` function can operate on any object that is a subclass of `Shape`, allowing different shapes to be used interchangeably.
- **Prevents Instantiation**: You cannot create an instance of `Shape` directly, preventing incomplete or improper usage of the class.

### Complete Code

Here's the complete code to run:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def perimeter(self):
        pass

class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height

    def area(self):
        return self.width * self.height

    def perimeter(self):
        return 2 * (self.width + self.height)

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    def area(self):
        return 3.14159 * self.radius * self.radius

    def perimeter(self):
        return 2 * 3.14159 * self.radius

def print_shape_info(shape: Shape):
    print(f"Area: {shape.area()}")
    print(f"Perimeter: {shape.perimeter()}")

# Create instances of Rectangle and Circle
rect = Rectangle(3, 4)
circle = Circle(5)

# Use the function with different shapes
print("Rectangle Info:")
print_shape_info(rect)
print("\nCircle Info:")
print_shape_info(circle)
```

Running this code will output the area and perimeter of both the rectangle and the circle, demonstrating the use of abstract methods and polymorphism.
